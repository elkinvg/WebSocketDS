## Server mode

Server mode is `ser` or `ser_cli_all_ro` or `ser_cli_all` or `ser_cli_ali` or  `ser_cli_ali_ro`

The listening device must be written in the property `DeviceServer`

The list of readable attributes must be listed in the property `Attributes`

If you want to listen to a group of devices, the "Options" property must contain a string `group`. `DeviceServer` must contain name pattern for group (e.g., domain_*/family/member_*)

#### Data from device

			"data": ["data", "array"]
		},
	],
	"pipe":
		{
			"attrName1" : "Data in format dependent on type",
			"attrName2" : ["Data in format", "dependent on type"]

}
```

## Work with events

Subscription to events is possible in all modes except `Server`.

#### Subscribing to events

The following event types are currently supported: `CHANGE_EVENT`, `PERIODIC_EVENT`, `ARCHIVE_EVENT`, `USER_EVENT`

To subscribe to events, you need to send a message in this format

```json
{
	"type_req": "eventreq_add_dev",
	"id": "id",
	"change": {
		"name_of_device": "atrribute_name or array of names",
		"name_of_other_device": "atrribute_name"
	},
	"periodic": {
		"name_of_device": "atrribute_name or array of names",
		"name_of_other_device": "atrribute_name"
	},
	"user": {
		"name_of_device": "atrribute_name or array of names",
		"name_of_other_device": "atrribute_name"
	},
	"archive": {
		"name_of_device": "atrribute_name or array of names",
		"name_of_other_device": "atrribute_name"
	}
}
```

The answer in case of success:

```json
{
	"event":"read",
	"type_req": "eventreq_add_dev", 
	"id_req": 2, 
	"resp": [
		{
			"device": "name/of/device", 
			"attribute": "attribute name", 
			"event_type": "Event type", 
			"event_id": 2
		}
	]
}
```

Here `"event_id"` is the event subscription id. It can be used to further unsubscribe from the event.

#### Full unsubscription from events

To unsubscribe from all events subscribed to, you need to send a message:

```json
{
	"type_req": "eventreq_off",
	"id": "id"
}
```

#### Partial unsubscription from events

To unsubscribe from individual events, you need to send:

```json
{
	"type_req": "eventreq_rem_dev",
	"id": "id",
	"event_id": 12345
}
```

Here `"event_id"` is the event subscription id.

#### Get the subscriber id

If you want to get the subscriber id, send

```json
{
	"type_req": "eventreq_check_dev",
	"id": "id",
	"device": "name/of/device", 
	"attribute": "attribute name", 
	"event_type": "Event type"
}
```

The answer in case of success:
```json
{
	"event":"read",
	"type_req": "eventreq_check_dev", 
	"id_req": 2, 
	"resp": [
		{
			"device": "name/of/device", 
			"attribute": "attribute name", 
			"event_type": "Event type", 
			"event_id": -1
		}
	]
}
```


## Authorization and authentication

To execute the command, the client must be authenticated.

Authorization and authentication are performed in the Device `AuthDS`.

#### Method SIMPLE

`ws(wss)://ip_or_hostname:port?login=zzz&password=zzz`

Device `AuthDS` must contain method `check_user(const Tango::DevVarStringArray (*argin)` and return true or false.

   * **\(\*argin)[0]** = login
   * **\(\*argin)[1]** = password
   
Also the server should contain the method `check_permissions(const Tango::DevVarStringArray *argin)`, used for authentication. return true or false.
 
   * **\(\*argin)[0]** ‚Äî Device name
   * **\(\*argin)[1]** ‚Äî Running command
   * **\(\*argin)[2]** ‚Äî Ip
   * **\(\*argin)[3]** ‚Äî login 

#### Method USERANDIDENT

`ws(wss)://ip_or_hostname:port?login=yyy&rand_ident=yyy&rand_ident_hash=yyy`

To activate this feature, you need to define `tident=rndid` in Property "Options"

Device `AuthDS` must contain method `check_user_ident(const Tango::DevVarStringArray *argin)` and return true or false.

   * **\(\*argin)[0]** ‚Äî login
   * **\(\*argin)[1]** ‚Äî rand_ident. Random number/word stored/generated by the client
   * **\(\*argin)[2]** ‚Äî rand_ident_hash. For example MD5(rand_ident+login)
   
#### Method USERANDIDENT2

__2-step verification__

To activate this feature, you need to define `tident=rndid2` in Property "Options"

The same as in [Method USERANDIDENT](#method-userandident), but authentication will be after connecting

Authentication is executed in several stages.

Requests must be made sequentially

First. To start the authorization process, the user must send a message requesting a random number.

   ```json
   {
    "type_req": "rident_req",
    "id": "Request id",
    "login": "login"
   }
   ```
   
Second. The server generates a random number, stores it. Sends the following type of response to the client:

  ```json
  {
  	"event": "read",
  	"type_req": "rident_req",
  	"id_req": "Request id",
  	"rident": "random number"
  }
  ```
  
Third. The client calculates (depending on the requirements of the authorization module) the required response, and sends it to the server.

  ```json
  {
  	"type_req": "rident_ans",
  	"id": "Request id",
  	"rident_hash": "For example MD5(random_number_from_request+login)"
  }
  ```
  
Finish. The server will send a response:

  ```json
  {
  	"event": "read",
  	"type_req": "rident_ans",
  	"id_req": "Request id",
  	"success": "true or false"
  }
  ```
   
#### Method USERANDIDENT3

The same as in [Method USERANDIDENT](#method-userandident), but authentication will be after connecting

To activate this feature, you need to define `tident=rndid3` in Property "Options"

To authorize, send:

  ```json
  {
  	"type_req": "rident",
  	"id": "Request id",
  	"login": "login",
  	"rident": "rand_ident",
  	"rident_hash": "rand_ident_hash"
  }
  ```
  
The server will send a response:
  
  ```json
  {
  	"event": "read",
  	"type_req": "rident",
  	"id_req": "Request id",
  	"success": "true or false"
  }
  ```  

## Logging

To activate this feature, you need to define `uselog` in Property "Options"

Device `AuthDS` must contain method `send_log_command_ex(const Tango::DevVarStringArray *argin)`

 - **id** - autoincrement
 - **argin[0]** = timestamp_string (UNIX_TIMESTAMP)
 - **argin[1]** = login
 - **argin[2]** = deviceName (or group)
 - **argin[3]** = IP
 - **argin[4]** = commandName 
 - **argin[5]** = command in Json (–≤–≤–æ–¥–∏–º–∞—è –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –≤ json —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ç–µ)
 - **argin[6]** = statusBool (true if successful, otherwise false)
 - **argin[7]** = isGroup (true if group, otherwise false)

## Additional parameters for attributes, pipe and commands

Used in server mode

To add additional parameters, add in the postfix property

```
CommandOrAttrName;par1=val
```

or for several parameters

```
CommandOrAttrName;par1=val;par2;par3=34
```

Where par - is parameter, val - is value if required.

For pipe from updating data (property PipeName):

```
PipeName
AttrName;par1=val;par2
```

In the case of pipe in command mode (when requested) , parameters for individual attributes are set to property `Commands`. The name of the attribute must be appended with `;pipecomm`, as well as the required parameter.

```
AttrName;pipecomm;par1=val;par2
```

List of currently available parameters for commands and attributes:

 - For attributes, commands and pipe: **precf**, **precs**, **prec**
 - Only for attributes: **niter**
 - Only for command: **bindata**
 
#### Changing the  precision and formatting the output values of attributes, pipe, and commands

By default, `setprecision(5)` is used to output attribute, pipe, and command data.

To set other  precision values, add a postfix `;prec=N` to the attribute name. 

N is the required precision.

```
AttributeOrCommandName;prec=10
```

It is also possible to set additional formatting flags:

- **precf** - Setting the flag std::fixed
- **precs** - Setting the flag std::scientific

Example output for 1476379200 (type double with precision = 10)

- **;prec=10** - output: 1476379200
- **;precf=10** - output: 1476379200.0000000000
- **;precs=10** - output: 1.4763792000e+009

Example output for 1476379200 (type double with precision  by default)
- **;precf** - output: 1476379200.000000
- **;precs** - output: 1.476379e+009

#### Setting the periodicity of the output of values for attributes

Used in server mode or for timer

For individual attributes, you can set the frequency of the output. To set the periodicity for the attribute name in the property (or in input message for timer), add `;niter=N/M` or `;niter=N`

 - **N** - Output once in N iterations.  (unsigned short)
 - **M** - The iteration number at which the value is displayed.
 
`M` should be less than `N`. The default value for `M` is `0`.

## The format of the returned error messages

Reading attributes in server mode:

```json
{
	"event": "error",
	"type_req": "attribute",
	"err_mess": "–°–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∏"
}
```

Other Requests:

```json
{
	"event": "error",
	"type_req": "Request Type",
	"name_req": "Request Name (If used)",
	"id_req": "Request id",
	"err_mess": "message or [Message array]"
}
```
